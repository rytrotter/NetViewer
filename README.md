# NetViewer
This (someday fully graphical) application will let you monitor your network traffic in a clean / simple GUI

(06/08/2018)                                                                
This is my first 'Big' project, so far I'm proud of how it's coming together so please don't make me too sad.
So far, this will display your IP address, hostname, connected network, and network strength in a simple UI.

(Future)                                                                              
I have plans to get this to reach out and find different hosts on the network and display a 'mapped out' form 
of them in the largest of the boxes. Then, to the right of that, I'd like to give a list of all the active hosts 
on the network.
